 * @brief Allocates built-in self-threaded threading implementation object.
 *
 * A self-threaded implementation is a type of implementation that performs 
 * processing of posted calls by means of caller thread itself. This type of 
 * implementation does not need thread pool to serve it.
 * 
 * Note that since May 9th, 2017 (rev. #2066) the Self-Threaded implementation 
 * returns 0 rather than 1 as available thread count to distinguish from 
 * thread pools with just one thread in them.
 *
 * The processing is arranged in a way to prevent call stack depth growth 
 * as more and more nested calls are posted.
 *
 * Note that it is not necessary to create and assign a self-threaded 
 * implementation to a world, as there is a global one used by default 
 * if no implementation is explicitly assigned. You should only assign 
 * each world an individual threading implementation instance if simulations 
 * need to be run in parallel in multiple threads for the worlds.
