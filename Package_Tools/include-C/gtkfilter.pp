 * @GTK_FILTER_MATCH_ALL: The filter matches all items,

 * @GTK_FILTER_CHANGE_MORE_STRICT: The filter is more strict than

 * Describes changes in a filter in more detail and allows objects
 * using the filter to optimize refiltering items.
 *
 * If you are writing an implementation and are not sure which
 * value to pass, %GTK_FILTER_CHANGE_DIFFERENT is always a correct
