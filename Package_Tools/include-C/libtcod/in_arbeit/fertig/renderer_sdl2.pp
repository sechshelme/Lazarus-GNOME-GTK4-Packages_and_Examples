    Return a new SDL2 atlas created from a tileset for an SDL2 renderer.

procedure TCOD_sdl2_atlas_delete(atlas:PTCOD_TilesetAtlasSDL2);cdecl;external;
{*
    Setup a cache and target texture for rendering.

    `atlas` is an SDL2 atlas created with `TCOD_sdl2_atlas_new`.
    The renderer used to make this `atlas` must support
    `SDL_RENDERER_TARGETTEXTURE`.

    `console` is a non-NULL pointer to the libtcod console you want to render.

    `cache` can be NULL, or be pointer to a console pointer.
    If `*cache` is NULL then a console will be created.
    If `*cache` isn't NULL then the console pointed to might be deleted or
    recreated if it does not match the size of `console`.

    `target` must be a pointer to where you want the output texture to be placed.
    The texture at `*target` may be deleted or recreated.  When this function
    is successful then the texture at `*target` will be non-NULL and will be
    exactly fitted to the size of `console` and the tile size of `atlas`.

    If SDL2 ever provides a `SDL_RENDER_TARGETS_RESET` event then the console
    at `*cache` must be deleted and set to NULL, or else the next render will
    only partially update the texture at `*target`.

    Returns a negative value on an error, check `TCOD_get_error`.

function TCOD_sdl2_render_texture_setup(atlas:PTCOD_TilesetAtlasSDL2; console:PTCOD_Console; cache:PPTCOD_Console; target:PPSDL_Texture):TTCOD_Error;cdecl;external;
{*
    Render a console onto a managed target texture.

    This function assumes that `cache` and `target` are valid.
    You can use `TCOD_sdl2_render_texture_setup` to automatically prepare these
    objects for use with this function.

    `atlas` is an SDL2 atlas created with `TCOD_sdl2_atlas_new`.
    The renderer used to make this `atlas` must support
    `SDL_RENDERER_TARGETTEXTURE`, unless `target` is NULL.

    `console` is a non-NULL pointer to the libtcod console you want to render.

    `cache` can be NULL, or point to a console the same size as `console`.

    `target` can be NULL, or be pointer an SDL2 texture used as the output.
    If `target` is not NULL then it should be the size of the console times the
    size of the individual tiles to fit the entire output.

    If `target` is NULL then the current render target is used instead, the
    drawn area will not be scaled to fit the render target.

    If SDL2 ever provides a `SDL_RENDER_TARGETS_RESET` event then the console
    at `cache` must be cleared, or else the next render will only partially
    update the texture of `target`.

    Returns a negative value on an error, check `TCOD_get_error`.
