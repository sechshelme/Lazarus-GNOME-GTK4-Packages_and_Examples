{*
    Generate noise as a vectorized operation.

    `noise` is the TCOD_Noise object to be used.  Its dimensions will
    determine how many input arrays are required.

    `type` is which noise generator should be used.
    Can be `TCOD_NOISE_DEFAULT` to use the type set by the TCOD_Noise object.

    `n` is the length of the input and output arrrays.

    `x[n]`, `y[n]`, `z[n]`, `w[n]` are the input coordinates for the noise
    generator.  For a 2D generator you'd provide the `x[n]` and `y[n]` arrays
    and leave the remaining arrays as NULL.

    `out[n]` is the output array, which will receive the noise values.
