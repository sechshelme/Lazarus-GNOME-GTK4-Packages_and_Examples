 *  \brief Initialize the libtcod graphical engine.
 *
 *  \param w The width in tiles.
 *  \param h The height in tiles.
 *  \param title The title for the window.
 *  \param fullscreen Fullscreen option.
 *  \param renderer Which renderer to use when rendering the console.
 *
 *  You may want to call TCOD_console_set_custom_font BEFORE calling this
 *  function.  By default this function loads libtcod's `terminal.png` image
 *  from the working directory.
 *
 *  Afterwards TCOD_quit must be called before the program exits.
 *
 *  Returns 0 on success, or -1 on an error, you can check the error with
 *  TCOD_sys_get_error()
 *
 *  `renderer` and vsync settings can be overridden by the `TCOD_RENDERER` or
 *  `TCOD_VSYNC` environment variables.
 *
 *  Valid case-sensitive options for `TCOD_RENDERER` are:
 *  - sdl
 *  - opengl
 *  - glsl
 *  - sdl2
 *  - opengl2
 *
 *  Valid options for `TCOD_VSYNC` are `0` or `1`.
 *
 *  \rst
 *  .. versionchanged:: 1.12
 *      Now returns -1 on error instead of crashing.
 *
 *  .. versionchanged:: 1.13
 *      Added the `TCOD_RENDERER` and `TCOD_VSYNC` overrides.
