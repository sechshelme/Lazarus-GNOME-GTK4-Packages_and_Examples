{*
    A struct of paramers used to create a new context with `TCOD_context_new`.
  }
{*
      Must be `TCOD_COMPILEDVERSION`.
    }
{*
      `window_x` and `window_y` are the starting position of the window.
      These are SDL parameters so values like `SDL_WINDOWPOS_UNDEFINED` and
      `SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED` are acceptable.

      Values of zero will be converted to `SDL_WINDOWPOS_UNDEFINED` unless
      `window_xy_defined` is true.
    }
{*
      `pixel_width` and `pixel_height` are the desired size of the window in pixels.
      If these are zero then they'll be derived from `columns`, `rows`, and the `tileset`.
    }
{*
      `columns` and `rows` are the desired size of the terminal window.
      Usually you'll set either these or the pixel resolution.
    }
{*
      `renderer_type` is one of the `TCOD_renderer_t` values.
    }
{*
      `tileset` is an optional pointer to a tileset object.
      If this is NULL then a platform specific fallback tileset will be used.
      This fallback is known to be unreliable, but it should work well enough
      for prototyping code.
    }
{*
      If `vsync` is true, then vertical sync will be enabled whenever possible.
      A value of true is recommended.
    }
{*
      `sdl_window_flags` is a bitfield of SDL_WindowFlags flags.
      For a window, a value of ``SDL_WINDOW_RESIZABLE`` is recommended.
      For fullscreen, a value of
      ``SDL_WINDOW_RESIZABLE | SDL_WINDOW_FULLSCREEN_DESKTOP`` is recommended.
      You should avoid the ``SDL_WINDOW_FULLSCREEN`` flag whenever possible.
    }
{*
      `window_title` will be the title of the opened window.
    }
(* Const before type ignored *)
{*
      The number of items in `argv`.
    }
{*
      `argc` and `argv` are optional CLI parameters.
      You can pass `0` and `NULL` respectfully to ignore them.
      If unsure then you should pass the `argc` and `argv` arguments from your
      `main` function.
    }
(* Const before type ignored *)
(* Const before declarator ignored *)
{*
      If user attention is required for the given CLI parameters then
      `cli_output` will be called with `cli_userdata` and an error or help
      message.
      If `cli_output` is NULL then it will print the message to stdout and
      terminate the program.  If `cli_output` returns normally then
      TCOD_E_REQUIRES_ATTENTION will be returned from `TCOD_context_new`.
    }
(* Const before type ignored *)
{*
      This is passed to the `userdata` parameter of `cli_output` if called.
    }
{*
      If this is false then `window_x`/`window_y` parameters of zero are
      assumed to be undefined and will be changed to `SDL_WINDOWPOS_UNDEFINED`.
