{*
    Add a node to this frontier.

    `index[frontier->ndim]` is the position of the node to add to the frontier.

    `dist` is the total distance of the node.  This should be a low number
    like 0, but can also be a negative number such as `INT_MIN`.
    When adding a node as an edge then `dist` is `frontier->active_dist` plus
    the cost of the edge.

    `heuristic` is the true priority of the node, used to affect node order.
    For Dijkstra-like algorithms this should be the same as `dist`.
    For A* this should be `dist` plus the maximum possible distance to the
    goal.
