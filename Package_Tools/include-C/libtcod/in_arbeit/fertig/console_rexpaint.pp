    In C++, you can pass the filepath directly to the :any:`TCODConsole`

    1=fast, 6=balanced, 9=slowest, 0=uncompressed.
    \return ``true`` when the file is saved successfully, or ``false`` when an

    \return Returns a TCOD_list_t of TCOD_console_t objects.  Or NULL on an
    error.  You will need to delete this list and each console individually.

    This function can load a REXPaint file with variable layer shapes,
    which would cause issues for a function like TCOD_console_list_from_xp.

    This function can save any number of layers with multiple
    different sizes.

    The REXPaint tool only supports files with up to 9 layers where
    all layers are the same size.
