 * This file defines version macros for LibVLC.
 * Those macros are primilarly intended for conditional (pre)compilation.
 * To get the run-time LibVLC version, use libvlc_get_version() instead
 * (the run-time version may be more recent than build-time one, thanks to
 * backward binary compatibility).

 * \version This header file is available in LibVLC 1.1.4 and higher.
