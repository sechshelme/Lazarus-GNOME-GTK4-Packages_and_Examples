{ fribidi_shape - do bidi-aware shaping
 *
 * This function does all shaping work that depends on the resolved embedding
 * levels of the characters.  Currently it does mirroring and Arabic shaping,
 * but the list may grow in the future.  This function is a wrapper around
 * fribidi_shape_mirroring and fribidi_shape_arabic.
 *
 * The flags parameter specifies which shapings are applied.  The only flags
 * affecting the functionality of this function are those beginning with
 * FRIBIDI_FLAG_SHAPE_.  Of these, only FRIBIDI_FLAG_SHAPE_MIRRORING is on
 * in FRIBIDI_FLAGS_DEFAULT.  For details of the Arabic-specific flags see
 * fribidi_shape_arabic.  If ar_props is NULL, no Arabic shaping is performed.
 *
 * Feel free to do your own shaping before or after calling this function,
 * but you should take care of embedding levels yourself then.
